# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-3 8B with Unsloth

## Overview
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for fine-tuning the **LLaMA-3 8B** model using **Unsloth** on a custom dataset formatted in the **Alpaca** style. The fine-tuning process leverages efficient memory optimizations, including **4-bit quantization**, and is designed to run on **limited hardware resources** like Google Colab.

## Features
- Fine-tunes **LLaMA-3 8B** using **Unsloth** for optimized performance.
- Uses **4-bit quantization** to reduce memory consumption.
- Trains on an **Alpaca-style dataset** with instruction-response pairs.
- Implements **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** using **SFTTrainer** from `trl`.
- Saves the fine-tuned model in **GGUF format** for efficient CPU-based inference.

## Installation
Before running the notebook, install the necessary dependencies using `unsloth`, `xformers`, `trl`, `peft`, `accelerate`, and `bitsandbytes`.

## Dataset Format (Alpaca Style)
The fine-tuning dataset follows the **Alpaca format**, where each sample consists of an instruction, optional input, and expected output response.

## Model Loading
We initialize the **LLaMA-3 8B** model with **4-bit quantization** for memory efficiency using `FastLanguageModel` from Unsloth.

## Fine-Tuning Configuration
The training is performed using **SFTTrainer** with configurations such as batch size, gradient accumulation, learning rate, and optimization strategies.

## Training Execution
Once configured, the fine-tuning process is executed, logging training statistics and monitoring progress.

## Saving the Fine-Tuned Model
The trained model is saved in **GGUF format**, which is optimized for CPU inference and compatible with `llama.cpp`.

## Loading the Fine-Tuned Model for Inference
The saved model can be reloaded for inference or further fine-tuning using `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained_gguf`.
